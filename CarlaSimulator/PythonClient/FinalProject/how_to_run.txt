Running the CARLA simulator
============================

In one terminal, start the CARLA simulator at a 30hz fixed time-step:

Ubuntu:
-------
./CarlaUE4.sh /Game/Maps/Course4 -windowed -carla-server -benchmark -fps=30

Windows:
--------
CarlaUE4.exe /Game/Maps/Course4 -windowed -carla-server -benchmark -fps=30

Running the Python client (and controller)
==========================================

In another terminal, change the directory to go into the "Course4FinalProject" folder, under the "PythonClient" folder.

Run your controller, execute the following command while CARLA is open:

Ubuntu (use alternative python commands if the command below does not work, as described in the CARLA install guide):
------
python3 module_7.py

Windows (use alternative python commands if the command below does not work, as described in the CARLA install guide):
